##Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

##Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-
technical person.

A repository is similar to a file system on your computer. It's a place to store all the files from a particular project. To create a repository, you can go on the GitHub website and press the "+" button next to your profile picture. Once you've done that, select "new repository" and follow the instructions from there. If in doubt about any of the settings, select public and add an MIT License.

Once your repository is set-up you are ready to clone (download) the repository to your local computer. Cloning a repository is just like download a zip file, except it has some bonus features. Since you download through Git, your copy of the repository will come with the project history and will be already linked to GitHub. That means that if you clone a repository you can use gitcommands to interact with GitHub, if you download it you can't.

Anyway, to clone a repository you need the URL of that repository's git file. You can copy the URL from the HTTPS clone url box located on the right side of the Github site. If you can't find it you can figure it out just with the URL for your repository. The link they provide is simply the URL for your repository with the ".git" appended to the end. So https://github.com/myusername/myrepository would be https://github.com/myusername/myrepository.git.

Finally, once you have your URL, you can open your command line and type in "git clone {URL HERE}." Whatever directory you run that command from will be where the repository is cloned to.

##Describe what open source means.

All programs have source code and code that only the computers understand. Many programs conceal the source code so that only the developers have access to it. They use the code to create an installer which translates the source code into a language an individual computer can understand.

Open source is when people anywhere can freely access the source code and make changes to it. This means that if you notic a bug in a program, you can address it yourself and suggest they add your solution to the master source code. It also allows people to freely contribute improvements on the central code. This makes it potentially less secure and, in many cases, harder or impossible to monetize.

##What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think Open Source sounds like a big positive. Many people can make several small contributions and it can add up fast and really turn into something cool that would have taken only a few people ages to build on their own.

It does not make me nervous or protective, it makes me hopeful more than anything. Anything open source just makes me think it has a lot of potential, it seems more responsive to users and more rapidly adaptable. That could be completely wrong, that's just my impression.

Despite that, Open Source doesn't feel like Utopia, mostly because I think it goes against the rest of how society works. Most of society you do a project, you create something and then you sell it and then whatever people want to pay for it is its value. Open Source seems like it sucks a lot of value out of society. I don't want to go into a big thing in my reflection, and Wikepedia reassures me that this is not the case. I just simply think we haven't filled our capacity of programmers in the country and the next few generations will understand code (and code will be easier to understand), and when that happens the position of Open Source will be drastically different.

##Assess the importance of using licenses.

Liscenses affect how people can access and use something you have created. Using a liscence prevents plagiarism and allows you to take ownership for your work. Using an open-source license can require people who use your code to keep their version free. This makes sure that when people change your code, they stay collaborators and not competitors.

##What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I think open source was most solidified as a concept. I always just thought of it as free and collaborative, but reading about the difference between source code and computer code was a big "aha" moment for me.

I didn't struggle with the section nearly as much as the last, but I think it took some time to wrap my head around why liscensing benefits collaboration. I'm not sure I fully understand, but I think it's an issue of reliscensing and just simple keeping people honest/

##Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-recommendations.html  -- helped me understand the liscences, it's basically just reworded from what you provided. I also read the wikepedia pages for relevant topics to be sure.

##Using your new git and GitHub skills, commit and push your changes to your remote repository and go through the pull request process! Make sure you can see your reflection on GitHub.
