#1.1 Think About Time Reflection

Personally I found the meditation very helpful. I've meditated before, but when I used the headspace app, I could really feel a release of pressure in my head and I felt more focused with my next few tasks. So for starters I want to set aside some time every day for meditating, and also to make sure to improve my meditating. 

Time boxing I learned is a way of setting aside time to work on a project, then when that time limit is up you evaluate your progress and make adjustments going forward. It seems like a great idea to me to keep you, or a team, from getting into ruts. Although I think it would also help with keep work efficient and also allowing time for the subconscious to process everything. I want to first apply it to Phase 0 by setting aside 30 minutes to work through a couple of releases and then address how effective that time has been. I want to improve spacing out my work evenly over a few days, and this seems like a process that would go hand-in-hand with reaching that goal.

Between when I was accepted into Dev Bootcamp and now, I took the Coursera "Learning How to Learn" course and I've been working on incorporating those ideas into my daily routine. I try to manage my time by having goals for what I want to achieve before the end of my day. The night before I figure out what I want to get done, and then that day I make a set time to finish working. I try to keep my goals to 3 or 4 big things. This generally works, although I find some weeks I lose a day from having trouble motivating myself or focusing. I still get work done, but nowhere near where I want to be. I procrastinate and take breaks, but I can usually break that the next day.

Based off learning about time boxing and creating new habits, I want to start managing my time with smaller time boxes and maybe add in some small slots of time to just start projects and get the lay of the land rather than starting in one day an hoping to finish as fast as I can. 

For my overall Phase 0 time management plan, I want to start putting in some time to meditate as well as time before I start a task to recap things I've done lately. I also want to start the week, once the assignments are available, by going over everything and creating a rough outline to finish everything early, maybe by Friday if it works out that week. Then I can re-evaluate that as I timebox out tasks and I can adjust how much of Phase 0 I want done in a day and how much I need to get done on the weekends.

#1.2 The Command Line Reflection

1. The shell is the way a user interacts with the computer, and the bash is a specific implementation of that which uses a command-line to to navigate the computer.

2. Differentiating between the | < and << operators. On a high level, it really sunk in the point they exist, to avoid hack-y creation of temporary files. But from a use of symbol perspective it really seemed like the < could have been used for piping.

3. Yes, I skimmed through the crash course and tried to use everything at least once.

4. That's a tough one. I'm going to say apropos and man. CD, pwd and ls I knew already, and it seems like you can do quite a bit with pure navigation, but with the help commands you can figure so much out potentially.

5. pwd - print working directory

ls - list items in working directory

mv - move, although the example they gave made it seem more like rename.

cd - change directory

../ - an input for cd to go back to a parent folder

touch - create a blank file

mkdir - make directory

less - opens up a file in a temporary box

rmdir - remove directory (must be empty)

rm - remove item

help - takes a command as input, shows a description

#1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

Assuming this person already has github setup, I would explain to them to click the plus button and hit "new repository." This makes a new repository, which is like a file system to keep all of your code and other related files in. If you want to work on someone else's repository, you can get your own copy of their repository. This is called "forking" and you can fork someone else's repository by visiting it on the github site and hitting the fork button. Github will automatically fork a copy to your account, so you can work on the code without interfering with other people. Forking prevents you from interfering, and it also acts like citing your work since you can trace the fork back to the original repository, no one mistakes it all for your own.

Since I have windows and I'm using the virtual machine, I wasnt quite sure where to clone the repositories. I wanted to clone it to a shared space between the VM and my computer, but I couldn't figure that out. Other than that, things went pretty smoothly. I did look for a git "delete" type of command, before realizing I could just delete my clone.
