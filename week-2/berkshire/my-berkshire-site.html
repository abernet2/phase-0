<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	Between Codecademy, little personal side projects I've done and preparation for this class, it really wasn't anything new. After looking over these questions, I wish I had experimented with the HTML5 documents because that would have been something new, and I would have liked to wakl through the steps to ensure the site will still function with IE.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	We actually didn't use any specific HTML5 elements. We used divs for the header and footer. In hindsight, I think there was a place in this for every element that we learned about. The header could easily be a header element, the footer is obvious too. The Geico ad would be an aside. The links I would put in as a nav and I guess I could make the comments section an article.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	No problem there, it really wasn't too hard to restrain from formatting.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
	The good of HTML seems to me like its simplicity. Which I guess is also the bad part. We used a lot of structural analogies when talking about HTML, and this site we made makes it apparent that even that distinction is really minimal. Basically without any CSS, it seems like almost every website would look somewhat similar to this, although likely with more images/content. So I think there's a deceptive ease to HTML, where you can structure things a few different ways to get a similar result, but the devil will really be in the details once we have bigger concerns about responsiveness, accessibility and also design.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	I don't think I have any tricks, but I'd love to hear some good ones. I basically just try to practice this stuff until its second nature. I like to learn by experimentation, I guess that's my trick.
