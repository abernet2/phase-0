##1. What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

The six phases of web design are:
1. **Information Gathering:** Gathering information about the business goals and dreams that this site should fulfill. Questions like: who is this site aimed at? What are we trying to acheive in this site and what kind of content are we looking to post? All will help inform and better structure your website as you build on.

2. **Planning:** This is where you map out all the main topic areas and perhaps even sub-topics. The point of planning is to flesh out where different content will go, and to ensure the site navigation makes logical sense. This is also the time when the developer will help choose what technologies will be necessary to achieve the desired results.

3. **Design:** Now that you have a broad overview of where the content go and what you'll need on the site, you have enough to build what the site will look like. This part of the process shouldn't involve any code, it should instead be a mock-up drawn to look like a snapshot of the page. The design phase usually begins with wire-framing, and should end with colored and nuanced designs.

4. **Development:** Once the site is designed, the developer has a template to emulate and knows what code needs to be written to get web browsers to render the design correctly.

5. **Testing and Delivery:** Once the site is running, it is best to check that all the forms work correctly, that the site works with different browsers and on different mobile devices. This is also where code validation is done and many of the functions of SEO are performed in this stage.

6. **Maintenance:** Last, but not least, you have to maintain a website in order to keep it looking current and to offer new products on a regular basis. 

##2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My website's primary goal is to better communicate to the world my abilities as well as my beliefs, interests and goals.

##3. What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience is made up of potential employers, fellow DBC students and perhaps even potential customers.

##4. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have  several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors. What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

That's a good question, and I think one that should eventually be to show my portfolio. In the more immediate future, I think it's more important to present where I want to go rather than where I've been, since I'm going to be working as a junior or entry level developer. So I think that presenting information about myself should be more important in the present. Whether that is blog posts or recommended articles.

##6. What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User Experience design encompasses every "experience" a "user" has with your business/company. Usually for the purpose of web development, this means that every design choice has to be made with the end goal of being easy-to use and intuitive. Additionally, User Experience can also encompass performance of the product you are selling (in addition to the website), as well as the user's experience of your advertising, marketing and even customer support. It's really just an extremely detailed and thought out set of processes to make sure customers are happy when they interact with your business.

##7. Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I found the wireframing extremely tedious for some reason. It was an odd situation where I felt I wanted a site that was too simple, and so I felt like I had to fill up my site map. So I added extra sub-topics that I think I might rethink and pare down in the next couple of days. If this were a purely personal website, I feel like I could add a lot of features about my interests such as: recommended articles, movies/tv I like, music and just general ideas. Like a blog, but shorter, more visual and probably not very helpful for any potential employers or even people surfing the web. So I guess some of that will get taken into the blog section, maybe, but I don't even know if I want to keep the personal interests section over there. 

So yeah, I guess I went on a little tangent, but I feel like for the needs of my site, I have too much, but it felt a little useless and tedious to map out what I thought I would need.
