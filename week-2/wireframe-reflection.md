###What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a rough sketch of the layout of the webpage. In most cases, they omit the colors, images, dinstinct fonts and other features of a website in favor of determining a general flow of information and of the layout.

###What are the benefits of wireframing?

The benefits of wireframing are that you can make sure your content will be readable and laid out correctly before going on to decorate. By wireframing first you prioritize the structure over many of the design decisions that can bog down a website.

###Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

No. Hahaha! I kind of enjoyed moving the pieces into place, but it felt so abstract to me I found it pretty uncomfortable. In a few different instances, I've been asked to make a simple webpage which I did by first making what I wanted the page to look like in Photoshop, and then trying to implement that in html. This makes more sense, and I'm sure after that it is the better practice, but nonetheless it was an uncomfortable excercise. I guess I gotta start growing the wireframing part of my brain, because I found it much harder than picking out colors and putting stuff in haphazardly.

###Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

Funny story, my first wireframe actually crashed without getting saved, so I decided to make a new one when I started over. My second wireframe was less of a revision, and more of an entirely different direction. My current wireframe is a little more basic, and it also has less features that I borrowed from other places, it was more an attempt for me to come up with a layout on my own. So I'm not super happy with it, but I think it's a better starting point.

###What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I really just wanted to find a better resource for wireframing. I ended up doing my first (the one I lost when my computer crashed) on Adobe Illustrator, and I did my second on Photoshop. I preferred Photoshop, most likely because I know it better, but I'm sure that professional software would save time if I were doing this everyday.

Other than that, I actually didn't look up to many resources for this challenge because when I got accepted into Dev Bootcamp I went on a little binge of wireframing websites because I thought it would be a useful skill. So I kind of knew the lay of land. Not that that meant anything, it seems like the sort of thing that just comes with lots of practice.

###Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I did a decent amount of research to try and get some inspiration for my wireframe. That was pretty fun and I'd compare it to figuring out something cool to draw and then going to draw and realizing you're really not ready to implement that idea yet. Which was unexpected because wireframing seems pretty easy from the outside. Maybe it is and I just am not great at expressing myself visually! It felt like I couldn't stop making the website look like a powerpoint presentation.

Anyway, even though I was surprised/frustrated by how hard I found wireframing, I really enjoyed thinking about the possibilities of a solid layout for a web app/site.
